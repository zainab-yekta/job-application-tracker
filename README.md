## Job Application Tracker (React.js Project)
A simple and effective web-based tool built with React.js that helps users track job applications, interviews, and rejections, while providing options for filtering, searching, exporting, and receiving interview notifications.

## Live Demo & Repository (How to Run This Project)
- **Live Site**: [Job Application Tracker (GitHub Pages)](https://zainab-yekta.github.io/job-application-tracker/)
- **GitHub Repo**: [View Source Code on GitHub](https://github.com/zainab-yekta/job-application-tracker)

## Updating the Project
After making any changes to the project files, follow these steps to update your GitHub repository and the deployed GitHub Pages site:

git add .
git commit -m "Describe your change here"
git push origin main

Once you push the changes to GitHub, GitHub Pages will automatically update your live site within a few seconds. This ensures that:
- Your repository stays up to date with the latest code.
- Your live deployed site reflects the most recent changes.

## Future Improvements (Planned)
- Add Login/Register authentication system
- Integrate persistent storage (localStorage or backend + database integration for cloud sync)
- Convert to Progressive Web App (PWA)

### Making a Progressive Web App
The base setup uses create-react-app, which supports PWA out of the box. You can enable it by modifying the serviceWorkerRegistration.js.

### Deployment
This app is deployed using:
- GitHub Pages â€” View Live Site
- Firebase Hosting â€” (Coming soon...)

## Notes
This project does not use a database. All data is stored in local component state and resets on refresh.
The authentication system is for demonstration only. It does not persist or validate real users.
