### Install dependencies
npm install uuid dayjs jspdf jspdf-autotable exceljs file-saver classnames
Plus the standard React packages that come with create-react-app.

## Start the development server
npm start

## How to Run This Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-application-tracker.git
   cd job-application-tracker
   npm install
   npm start

## Future Improvements (Planned)
- Add Login/Register authentication system
- Integrate persistent storage (localStorage or backend + database integration for cloud sync)
- Convert to Progressive Web App (PWA)

### Making a Progressive Web App
The base setup uses create-react-app, which supports PWA out of the box. You can enable it by modifying the serviceWorkerRegistration.js.

### Deployment
Deploying this app using:
GitHub Pages
Firebase Hosting
(Deployment guide coming soon...)

## Notes
This project does not use a database. All data is stored in local component state and resets on refresh.
The authentication system is for demonstration only. It does not persist or validate real users.
